# PWNfavicon for WAF Bypass

![banner](https://github.com/offensive-security-pwncat/PWNfavicon/blob/main/banner.png)

## Overview

The PWNfavicon is a Python-based reconnaissance tool designed to identify websites that potentially mirror the content of a specified URL, aiding in Web Application Firewall (WAF) bypass techniques. It operates by leveraging the analysis of favicon hashes, small icons associated with websites that are often overlooked in security assessments.

## Features

- **Favicon Hash Comparison** üîç: Analyzes the hash values of favicons across different websites.
- **Multi-threaded Crawling** üï∑Ô∏è: Utilizes multi-threading for concurrent fetching and analysis of multiple URLs.
- **Timeout Handling** ‚è±Ô∏è: Customizable timeout settings prevent delays while waiting for responses from unresponsive servers.
- **Verbose Logging** üìù: Detailed logging capabilities for monitoring the crawling process and diagnosing issues.
- **Input Parsing** üì•: Supports input in the form of CIDR ranges, domain names, or a base URL.
- **Result Reporting** üìä: Identifies matching URLs indicating potential content similarity to the base URL.

## Use Cases

- **WAF Bypass** üõ°Ô∏è: Helps evade detection or filtering mechanisms implemented by WAFs by identifying websites with similar content.
- **Red Team Engagements** üö©: Discovers additional entry points or shadow IT assets during red team operations.
- **Vulnerability Research** üîç: Analyzes the prevalence of specific web assets across different domains to identify common vulnerabilities.

## Usage

```bash
python PWNfavicon.py -u <base_url> -t <num_threads> -d <domain> -c <cidr>
```

## Options

- `-u, --url`: Specify the base URL directly.
- `-t, --threads`: Specify the number of threads to use (default is 10).
- `-h, --help`: Show the help message and exit.

Additional options:

- `-p, --ports`: Specify ports to check separated by commas.
- `--timeout`: Specify timeout for HTTP requests in seconds (default is 10).
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose mode for detailed logging.
- `-c, --cidr`: Specify CIDR ranges separated by commas.
- `-cf, --cidr-file`: Specify a file containing CIDR ranges.
- `-d, --domains`: Specify domains separated by commas.
- `-df, --domains-file`: Specify a file containing domains.

These options provide flexibility in customizing the crawling behavior according to specific requirements and scenarios.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- mmh3
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- colorama
- tqdm

## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the Favicon Crawler repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/favicon-crawler.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the directory containing the cloned repository:

```bash
cd PWNfavicon
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Then, install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary dependencies such as `mmh3`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `colorama`, and `tqdm`.

### 4. Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Favicon Crawler using the following command:

```bash
python PWNfavicon.py -u <base_url> -c <cidr>
```

Replace `<base_url>` with the target URL you want to analyze and `<cidr>` with the desired network change to scan.

### 5. Explore Options

Explore additional command-line options available for customization using the `--help` flag:

```bash
python PWNfavicon.py --help
```

This will display a list of available options such as specifying ports, setting timeouts, enabling verbose mode, and providing input via CIDR ranges or domain lists.

## Example Usage

```bash
python PWNfavicon.py -u "https://example.com" -c "199.98.50.0/24"
```

This command will crawl the target URL `https://example.com` and find if there is some page on the network `199.98.50.0/24`.

### Note

- Ensure that you have proper permissions and network access to crawl the target URLs.
- It is recommended to use this tool responsibly and ethically, respecting the terms of service and legal regulations governing web scraping and reconnaissance activities.
